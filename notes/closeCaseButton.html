  <h2>Final Step: Close the Case</h2>
  <br>
  <p>When a case is closed in the real EPIC system, a few important things happen to keep everything transparent and accountable.</p>
  <br>
  <p>It will say "Are you sure this case is ready to be closed? Yes/No. And if any secondary records will be terminated then highlight them here.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The relevant <strong>Unit Head</strong> gets an automatic email that includes:</p>
    <li>The incident details</li>
    <li>The case notes recorded from start to finish</li>
    <li>Direct links to approve or reject the closure from the email</li>
  <br>
