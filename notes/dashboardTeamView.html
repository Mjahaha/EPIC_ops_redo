  <h2>Team Dashboard</h2>
  <br>
  <p>This dashboard would mirror My Work, but at a team level so you can see workload and progress across everyone in your group.</p>
  <br>
  <p>It will highlight who has which actions and cases, how long they have held them, and where items may be blocked so you can spot bottlenecks quickly.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Expect filters and pivots similar to My Work, plus team rollups (by officer, case type, priority) to help reallocate work and keep things moving.</p>
